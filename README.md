# ResticLVM

> **A config-based tool for atomic, incremental backups — powered by [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) and [LVM2](https://sourceware.org/lvm2/).**

## Description

ResticLVM is a Linux command-line tool that combines the snapshot features of Logical Volume Manager (LVM) with the data deduplication and encryption features of the [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) backup tool to create consistent, efficient backups of active systems with minimal downtime.

ResticLVM uses a simple TOML configuration file format to define backup jobs, and provides CLI commands to run backups or prune old snapshots based on configuration settings.

Interaction with Restic and LVM is handled by a set of [Bash shell scripts](src/resticlvm/scripts/README.md), while a lightweight Python wrapper orchestrates the backup flow, provides the CLI interface, and enables installation as a Python package.


## How It Works:

- 📦 Creates a timestamped LVM snapshot of each logical volume to be backed up.

- 🔒 Mounts the snapshot to a temporary mount point.

- 📤 Runs Restic to back up the mounted snapshot to the configured repository.

- 🧹 Cleans up the snapshot automatically after backup completes.

This approach ensures that backup operations are fast, safe, and do not interfere with the running system.

## Requirements
- A Linux system with Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
- Python 3.11+.
- Restic installed and available in your $PATH.
- Root privileges required (direct root user or via sudo).
- Restic repositories must be manually created (using `restic init`) before using ResticLVM.


## Installing

Install ResticLVM directly from GitHub using pip:

### Install a specific version (recommended)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/duanegoodner/resticlvm.git@v0.1.2
```
Replace `v0.1.2` with the desired version tag from the [releases page](https://github.com/duanegoodner/resticlvm/releases).

### Install from main branch (latest, but not guaranteed stable)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/duanegoodner/resticlvm.git@main
```

This installs the CLI tools:

- `rlvm-backup` — Run backup jobs as defined in your configuration file.

- `rlvm-prune` —  Prune Restic snapshots according to the retention settings in your configuration.

## Config File Setup

ResticLVM is configured through a simple `.toml` file and supports three types of backup jobs:

| Backup Type                | Section Example                      | Description |
|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:------------|
| Standard filesystem path    | `[standard_path.boot]`               | Back up a normal directory (e.g., `/boot`) |
| LVM volume (mounted at `/`)  | `[logical_volume_root.lv_root]`      | Back up an LVM logical volume that is mounted at root |
| LVM volume (mounted elsewhere) | `[logical_volume_nonroot.data]`    | Back up an LVM volume mounted at another location (e.g., `/data`) |


### Backup Job Category and Name Hierarchy

Each section must be named according to this pattern:
```
<backup_category>.<job_name>
```
Where:

- `<backup_category>` must be one of:

    - `standard_path` — for regular file or directory paths.

    - `logical_volume_root` — for full logical volumes mounted at /.

    - `logical_volume_nonroot` — for logical volumes mounted elsewhere.

- `<job_name>` is a user-chosen identifier for that backup job (any valid name without spaces).


### Example `.toml` File

The example below shows one job configuration for each of the three supported categories. All fields shown for each category of job are required (Note that the fields required for a `standard_path` backup job differ from those required for `logical_volume_root` and `logical_volume_nonroot` jobs).



```toml
[standard_path.boot]
backup_source_path = "/boot"
restic_repo = "/backups/restic-boot"
restic_password_file = "/path/to/repopassword.txt"
exclude_paths = []
remount_readonly = true
prune_keep_last = 10
prune_keep_daily = 7
prune_keep_weekly = 4
prune_keep_monthly = 6
prune_keep_yearly = 1

[logical_volume_root.lv_root]
vg_name = "vg0"
lv_name = "lv0"
snapshot_size = "5G"
restic_repo = "/backups/restic-root"
restic_password_file = "/path/to/repopassword.txt"
backup_source_path = "/"
exclude_paths = [
  "/dev", "/proc", "/sys", "/tmp", "/var/tmp", "/run", "/media", "/mnt"
]
prune_keep_last = 10
prune_keep_daily = 7
prune_keep_weekly = 4
prune_keep_monthly = 6
prune_keep_yearly = 1

[logical_volume_nonroot.data]
vg_name = "vg_data"
lv_name = "lv_data"
snapshot_size = "5G"
restic_repo = "/backups/restic-data"
restic_password_file = "/path/to/repopassword.txt"
backup_source_path = "/data"
exclude_paths = ["/data/temp", "/data/cache"]
prune_keep_last = 10
prune_keep_daily = 7
prune_keep_weekly = 4
prune_keep_monthly = 6
prune_keep_yearly = 1
```
### Notes:
- `snapshot_size` must be large enough to capture any changes that occur to the original logical volume during the backup. A small snapshot size can lead to backup failure if the snapshot overflows.

- `exclude_paths` is a space-separated list (within the TOML array) of paths that will be excluded from the backup.

- `remount_readonly` applies only to standard_path backups; if true, the backup source will be temporarily remounted read-only during the backup.

- Each backup job must use a unique `restic_repo` path. Duplicate repositories across jobs are not allowed because Restic pruning operates at the repository level.

- The Restic repositories must already exist. (Use `restic init` manually to create each repo before using this tool.)


## Running Backups

### 🔹 Run all backup jobs:
```
rlvm-backup --config /path/to/your/resticlvm_config.toml
```
- Runs **all** backup jobs defined in the config.

- Automatically handles snapshots, bindings, Restic commands, and cleanup.

### 🔹 Run a Specific Backup Job
The `--category` and/or `--name` options can be used if we only want to run certain backup jobs.
```
# Run all jobs in a category
rlvm-backup --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category standard_path

# Run a single specific job
rlvm-backup --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category standard_path --name boot
```

## Pruning Snapshots

### 🔹Prune All Configured Repositories

```
rlvm-prune --config /path/to/your/resticlvm_config.toml
```
- Applies the configured prune_keep_* settings to each Restic repo.

- Handles Restic's `forget` and `--prune` commands.

### 🔹 Prune by Category or Job Name

We can also choose to prune only certain repos:
```
# Prune by category
sudo rlvm-prune --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category logical_volume_root

# Prune by specific job name
sudo rlvm-prune --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category logical_volume_root --name lv_root
```

### 🔹Protecting Specific Snapshots from Deletion

By default, all snapshots are subject to pruning according to your configured retention policies.

If you want to permanently protect a particular snapshot from being pruned:

1. List your current snapshots to find the snapshot ID:

   ```bash
   restic -r /path/to/restic-repo --password-file /path/to/password/file snapshots
   ```
2. Tag the snapshot you want to protect:

    ```
    restic tag --add protected --snapshot <snapshot-ID>
    ```
Snapshots tagged protected will automatically be preserved during pruning, regardless of age or retention rules. ResticLVM's pruning logic uses --keep-tag protected to ensure these snapshots are not deleted.
