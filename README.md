# ResticLVM

> **A config-based tool for atomic, incremental backups â€” powered by [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) and [LVM2](https://sourceware.org/lvm2/).**

## Description

ResticLVM is a Linux command-line tool that combines the snapshot features of Logical Volume Manager (LVM) with the data deduplication and encryption features of the [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) backup tool to create consistent, efficient backups of active systems with minimal downtime.

ResticLVM uses a simple TOML configuration file format to define backup jobs, and provides CLI commands to run backups or prune old snapshots based on configuration settings.

Interaction with Restic and LVM is handled by Bash shell scripts, while a lightweight Python wrapper provides the CLI and enables installation as a Python package.

## How It Works:

- ðŸ“¦ Creates a timestamped LVM snapshot of each logical volume to be backed up.

- ðŸ”’ Mounts the snapshot to a temporary mount point.

- ðŸ“¤ Runs Restic to back up the mounted snapshot to the configured repository.

- ðŸ§¹ Cleans up the snapshot automatically after backup completes.

This approach ensures that backup operations are fast, safe, and do not interfere with the running system.

## Requirements
- A Linux system with Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
- Python 3.11+.
- Restic installed and available in your $PATH.
- Root privileges required (scripts will request sudo if necessary).
- Restic repositories must be manually created (using `restic init`) before using ResticLVM.


## Installing

Install ResticLVM using `pip`:
```
pip install resticlvm
```
After installation, the following CLI commands will be available:

- `rlvm-backup` â€” Run backup jobs as defined in your configuration file.

- `rlvm-prune` â€”  Prune Restic snapshots according to the retention settings in your configuration.

## Config File Setup

ResticLVM is configured through a simple `.toml` file and supports three types of backup jobs:

| Backup Type                | Section Example                      | Description |
|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:------------|
| Standard filesystem path    | `[standard_path.boot]`               | Back up a normal directory (e.g., `/boot`) |
| LVM volume (mounted at `/`)  | `[logical_volume_root.lv_root]`      | Back up an LVM logical volume that is mounted at root |
| LVM volume (mounted elsewhere) | `[logical_volume_nonroot.data]`    | Back up an LVM volume mounted at another location (e.g., `/data`) |


### Backup Job Category and Name Hierarchy

Each section must be named according to this pattern:
```
<backup_category>.<job_name>
```
Where:

- `<backup_category>` must be one of:

    - `standard_path` â€” for regular file or directory paths.

    - `logical_volume_root` â€” for full logical volumes mounted at /.

    - `logical_volume_nonroot` â€” for logical volumes mounted elsewhere.

- `<job_name>` is a user-chosen identifier for that backup job (any valid name without spaces).


### Example `.toml` File

The example below shows one job configuration for each of the three supported categories. All fields shown for each category of job are required (Note that the fields required for a `standard_path` backup job differ from those required for `logical_volume_root` and `logical_volume_nonroot` jobs.



```toml
[standard_path.boot]
backup_source_path = "/boot"
restic_repo = "/backups/restic-boot"
restic_password_file = "/path/to/repopassword.txt"
exclude_paths = []
remount_readonly = true
prune_keep_last = 10
prune_keep_daily = 7
prune_keep_weekly = 4
prune_keep_monthly = 6
prune_keep_yearly = 1

[logical_volume_root.lv_root]
vg_name = "vg0"
lv_name = "lv0"
snapshot_size = "5G"
restic_repo = "/backups/restic-root"
restic_password_file = "/path/to/repopassword.txt"
backup_source_path = "/"
exclude_paths = [
  "/dev", "/proc", "/sys", "/tmp", "/var/tmp", "/run", "/media", "/mnt"
]
prune_keep_last = 10
prune_keep_daily = 7
prune_keep_weekly = 4
prune_keep_monthly = 6
prune_keep_yearly = 1

[logical_volume_nonroot.data]
vg_name = "vg_data"
lv_name = "lv_data"
snapshot_size = "5G"
restic_repo = "/backups/restic-data"
restic_password_file = "/path/to/repopassword.txt"
backup_source_path = "/data"
exclude_paths = ["/data/temp", "/data/cache"]
prune_keep_last = 10
prune_keep_daily = 7
prune_keep_weekly = 4
prune_keep_monthly = 6
prune_keep_yearly = 1
```
### Notes:
- `snapshot_size` must be large enough to capture any changes that occur to the original logical volume during the backup. A small snapshot size can lead to backup failure if the snapshot overflows.

- `exclude_paths` is a space-separated list (within the TOML array) of paths that will be excluded from the backup.

- `remount_readonly` applies only to standard_path backups; if true, the backup source will be temporarily remounted read-only during the backup.

- Each backup job must use a unique `restic_repo` path. Duplicate repositories across jobs are not allowed because Restic pruning operates at the repository level.

- The Restic repositories must already exist. (Use `restic init` manually to create each repo before using this tool.)


## CLI Usage

### ðŸ”¹ Run all backup jobs:
```
rlvm-backup --config /path/to/your/resticlvm_config.toml
```
- Runs **all** backup jobs defined in the config.

- Automatically handles snapshots, bindings, Restic commands, and cleanup.

### ðŸ”¹ Run a Specific Backup Job
The `--category` and/or `--name` options can be used if we only want to run certain backup jobs.
```
# Run all jobs in a category
rlvm-backup --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category standard_path

# Run a single specific job
rlvm-backup --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category standard_path --name boot
```

### ðŸ”¹ Prune Old Snapshots
```
rlvm-prune --config /path/to/your/resticlvm_config.toml
```
- Applies the configured prune_keep_* settings to each Restic repo.

- Handles Restic's `forget` and `--prune` commands.

We can also choose to prune only certain repos:
```
# Prune by category
sudo rlvm-prune --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category logical_volume_root

# Prune by specific job name
sudo rlvm-prune --config /path/to/resticlvm_config.toml --category logical_volume_root --name lv_root

```


### ðŸ”¹ CLI Help
