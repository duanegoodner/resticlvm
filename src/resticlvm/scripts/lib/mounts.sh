# Provides functions for remounting volumes, binding Restic repositories,
# and setting up minimal chroot environments for backup operations.
#
# Usage:
#   Intended to be sourced by backup scripts within the ResticLVM tool.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Must be run with root privileges (direct root or via sudo).
#   - mount, findmnt utilities must be available in PATH.
#
# Exit codes:
#   Non-zero if remounts or bind-mounts fail (unless in dry-run mode).
